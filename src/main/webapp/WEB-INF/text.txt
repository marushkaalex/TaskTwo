There's a note, underneath your front door,
That I wrote twenty years ago.
Yellow paper and a faded picture
And a secret in an envelope.

There's no reasons, no excuses.
There's no second-hand alibis.
Just some black ink on some blue lines
And a shadow you won't recognize.

In the meant-time I'll be waiting
For twenty years and twenty more.
I'll be praying for redemption
And your note underneath my door.
